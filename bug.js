This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The error message is usually something like "AsyncStorage has not been initialized".  This happens because the AsyncStorage library needs to be initialized before it can be used.  The common solutions often don't work because they address situations where AsyncStorage is available but not properly configured, not this initialization issue.
